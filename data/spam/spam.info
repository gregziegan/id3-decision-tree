1. Title: Network Flow Spam Classification

      network characteristics detect spam effectively in a stand-alone
      enterprise?.  In Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on

3. Relevant Information:
    The source paper attempts to classify email as "spam" or "ham" (the
    opposite of spam) based solely on the properties of the network interaction
    transmitting the message. This is in contrast to traditional spam
    filterning methods that use message content for classification.

    The emails used for this dataset were received by a single organization,
    the International Computer Science Institute (ICSI). Some message filtering
    is performed via a DNS blacklist before the messages in this dataset are
    observed. Ground truth labelings are performed via automated tools and a
    subset of the results have been verified by a human, so some labeling error
    is expected.

4. Number of instances: 74739 emails (46739 spam, 27997 ham)

5. Attributes:
    1. Example index
    2. geoDistance: Geographical distance between sender and ICSI, based on
         the MaxMind GeoIP database.
    3. senderHour: The hour of packet arrival in sender's timezone.
    4. AverageIPNeighborDistance: Avg. numerical dist. from sender’s IP to the
	 nearest 20 IPs of other senders of remote host as determined by p0f
         tool from SYN packet.
    5. fngr_wss: Advertised window size from SYN received from remote host.
    6. fngr_ttl: IP TTL ﬁeld from SYN received from remote host.
    7. OS: OS of remote host as determined by p0f tool from SYN packet.
           {Windows, Solaris, Linux, UNKNOWN, FreeBSD, Others}
    8. pkts_sunk/pkts_sourced: Ratio of the number of packets sent by the local
         host to the number of packets received from the remote host.
    9. rxmt_sourced: Approximate number of retransmissions sent by the remote
         host.
   10. rxmt_sunk: Number of retransmissions sent by the local mail server.
   11. rsts_sourced: Number of segments with "RST" bit set received from remote
         host.
   12. rsts_sunk: Number of segments with "RST" bit set sent by the local mail
         server.
   13. fins_sourced: Number of TCP segments with "FIN" bit set received from
         the remote host.
   14. fins_sunk: Number of TCP segments with "FIN" bit set sent by the local
         mail server.
   15. idle: Maximum time between two successive packet arrivals from remote
         host.
   16. 3whs: Time between the arrival of the SYN from the remote host and
         arrival of ACK of the SYN/ACK sent by the local host.
   17. jvar: The variance of the inter-packet arrival times from the remote
         host.
   18. rttv: Variance of RTT from local mail server to remote host.
   19. bytecount: Number of (non-retransmitted) bytes received from the
         remote host.
   20. throughput: "bytecount" divided by the connection duration.
   21. Class label (1 = spam, 0 = ham)

3. Relevant Information:
    The data was collected by the Magellan spacecraft over an approximately four
    year period from 1990--1994. The objective of the mission was to obtain
    global mapping of the surface of Venus using synthetic aperture radar (SAR).
    A more detailed discussion of the mission and objectives is available at
    JPL's Magellan webpage. 

    Ground Truth labels were obtained by experts, and contain labels
    indicating various degrees of certainty. To create a binary dataset, any
    instance with a certainty >= 0.5 is positive; other are negative.

    The original labels indicate the location and radius of each candidate
    volcano in the radar image files (some included in `images` folder). These
    volcanoes are extracted as 15-by-15 pixel "chips" around the center of each
    volcano. The chips are then flattened to form a 225-dimensional feature
    vector. The original image chips for each candidate are shown in
    `images/chips.png`, with positive instances at the top.

4. Number of instances: 2231 (731 volcanoes, 1500 non-volcanoes)

5. Attributes:
      1. Chip index
      2. Image ID (see `images` folder for some examples, or UCI repo for all images)
      3. Chip pixel value (8-bit unsigned integer)
         ...
    228. Class label
